# ControlStudies
These repository is a reunion of the scripts that I am writing in the process of studying Control Theory. 

My main sources are the Control Bootcamp playlist made by Steve Brunton, the Classical Control Theory playlist made by Brian Douglas and the Ogata's Modern Control Engineering 4th edition.
